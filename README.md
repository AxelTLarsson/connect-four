## Connect-four
The app is written in JavaScript and for the time being I am only doing a frontend. Backend may come later though.

### Run it
To make it fancy, install ```npm``` and then clone and cd into the project, then do  ```npm install jspm --save-dev```.
Then:
```
jspm install
npm install live-server -g
live-server
```
Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or whichever port ```live-server``` chooses.

Alternatively, either use ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` or the simplest way possible: just click the index.html file after having downloaded the zip or cloned the repo!
